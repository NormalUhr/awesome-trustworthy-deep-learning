## Common Robustness

### 2020

  - Linfeng Zhang, Muzhou Yu, Tong Chen, Zuoqiang Shi, Chenglong Bao, Kaisheng Ma. *CVPR 2020*
  - Digest: In this paper, we propose a novel training method via introducing the auxiliary classifiers for training on corrupted samples, while the clean samples are normally trained with the primary classifier.  

- Improving robustness against common corruptions by covariate shift adaptation. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16971) [[code]](https://github.com/bethgelab/robustness)
  - Steffen Schneider, Evgenia Rusak, Luisa Eck, Oliver Bringmann, Wieland Brendel, Matthias Bethge.
  - Digest: We here argue that popular benchmarks to measure model robustness against common corruptions (like ImageNet-C) underestimate model robustness in many (but not all) application scenarios. The key insight is that in many scenarios, multiple unlabeled examples of the corruptions are available and can be used for unsupervised online adaptation.  

- Beyond accuracy: quantifying trial-by-trial behaviour of CNNs and humans by measuring error consistency. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16736) [[code]](https://github.com/wichmann-lab/error-consistency)
  - Robert Geirhos, Kristof Meding, Felix A. Wichmann.
  - Digest: Here we introduce trial-by-trial error consistency, a quantitative analysis for measuring whether two decision making systems systematically make errors on the same inputs. Making consistent errors on a trial-by-trial basis is a necessary condition if we want to ascertain similar processing strategies between decision makers.  

- The Many Faces of Robustness: A Critical Analysis of Out-of-Distribution Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16241) [[dataset]](https://github.com/hendrycks/imagenet-r)
  - Dan Hendrycks, Steven Basart, Norman Mu, Saurav Kadavath, Frank Wang, Evan Dorundo, Rahul Desai, Tyler Zhu, Samyak Parajuli, Mike Guo, Dawn Song, Jacob Steinhardt, Justin Gilmer.
  - Digest: We introduce three new robustness benchmarks consisting of naturally occurring distribution changes in image style, geographic location, camera operation, and more. Using our benchmarks, we take stock of previously proposed hypotheses for out-of-distribution robustness and put them to the test.  

- ObjectNet Dataset: Reanalysis and Correction. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02042) [[code]](https://github.com/aliborji/ObjectNetReanalysis)
  - Ali Borji.
  - Digest: We highlight a major problem with their work which is applying object recognizers to the scenes containing multiple objects rather than isolated objects. The latter results in around 20-30% performance gain using our code. Compared with the results reported in the ObjectNet paper, we observe that around 10-15 % of the performance loss can be recovered, without any test time data augmentation.  

- CEB Improves Model Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05380)
  - Ian Fischer, Alexander A. Alemi.
  - Digest: We demonstrate that the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB) can improve model robustness. CEB is an easy strategy to implement and works in tandem with data augmentation procedures. We report results of a large scale adversarial robustness study on CIFAR-10, as well as the ImageNet-C Common Corruptions Benchmark, ImageNet-A, and PGD attacks.  

- Increasing the robustness of DNNs against image corruptions by playing the Game of Noise. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06057) [[code]](https://github.com/bethgelab/game-of-noise)
  - Evgenia Rusak, Lukas Schott, Roland S. Zimmermann, Julian Bitterwolf, Oliver Bringmann, Matthias Bethge, Wieland Brendel.
  - Digest: We demonstrate that a simple but properly tuned training with additive Gaussian and Speckle noise generalizes surprisingly well to unseen corruptions, easily reaching the previous state of the art on the corruption benchmark ImageNet-C (with ResNet50) and on MNIST-C.

  - Digest: A new method, which we refer to as convex layerwise adversarial training (COLT), that can train provably robust neural networks and conceptually bridges the gap between adversarial training and existing provable defense methods.

- Improving Robustness Without Sacrificing Accuracy with Patch Gaussian Augmentation. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02611)
  - Raphael Gontijo Lopes, Dong Yin, Ben Poole, Justin Gilmer, Ekin D. Cubuk.
  - Digest: We introduce Patch Gaussian, a simple augmentation scheme that adds noise to randomly selected patches in an input image. Models trained with Patch Gaussian achieve state of the art on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNetCommon Corruptions benchmarks while also improving accuracy on clean data.  

- Can You Trust Your Model's Uncertainty? Evaluating Predictive Uncertainty Under Dataset Shift. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02530) [[code]](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/uq_benchmark_2019)
  - Yaniv Ovadia, Emily Fertig, Jie Ren, Zachary Nado, D Sculley, Sebastian Nowozin, Joshua V. Dillon, Balaji Lakshminarayanan, Jasper Snoek. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest: Quantifying uncertainty is especially critical in real-world settings, which often involve input distributions that are shifted from the training distribution due to a variety of factors including sample bias and non-stationarity. In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted.  

- Making Convolutional Networks Shift-Invariant Again. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11486) [[code]](https://richzhang.github.io/antialiased-cnns/)
  - Richard Zhang. *ICML 2019*
  - Digest: Small shifts -- even by a single pixel -- can drastically change the output of a deep network (bars on left). We identify the cause: aliasing during downsampling. We anti-alias modern deep networks with classic signal processing, stabilizing output classifications (bars on right). We observe "free", unexpected improvements as well: accuracy increases and improved robustness.  

- Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261) [[dataset]](https://github.com/hendrycks/robustness)
  - Dan Hendrycks, Thomas Dietterich. *ICLR 2019*
  - Digest: In this paper we establish rigorous benchmarks for image classifier robustness. Our first benchmark, ImageNet-C, standardizes and expands the corruption robustness topic, while showing which classifiers are preferable in safety-critical applications. Then we propose a new dataset called ImageNet-P which enables researchers to benchmark a classifier's robustness to common perturbations.  

### 2018

- ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased towards texture; increasing shape bias improves accuracy and robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231) [[code]](https://github.com/rgeirhos/texture-vs-shape)
  - Robert Geirhos, Patricia Rubisch, Claudio Michaelis, Matthias Bethge, Felix A. Wichmann, Wieland Brendel. *ICLR 2019*
  - Digest: We show that ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and reveals fundamentally different classification strategies.  

- Generalisation in humans and deep neural networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08750) [[code]](https://github.com/rgeirhos/generalisation-humans-DNNs)
  - Robert Geirhos, Carlos R. Medina Temme, Jonas Rauber, Heiko H. Schütt, Matthias Bethge, Felix A. Wichmann. *NeurIPS 2018*
  - Digest: We compare the robustness of humans and current convolutional deep neural networks (DNNs) on object recognition under twelve different types of image degradations.  

- Why do deep convolutional networks generalize so poorly to small image transformations? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12177) [[code]](https://github.com/AzulEye/CNN-Failures)
  - Aharon Azulay, Yair Weiss. *JMLR 2019*
  - Digest: In this paper, we quantify this phenomena and ask why neither the convolutional architecture nor data augmentation are sufficient to achieve the desired invariance. Specifically, we show that the convolutional architecture does not give invariance since architectures ignore the classical sampling theorem, and data augmentation does not give invariance because the CNNs learn to be invariant to transformations only for images that are very similar to typical images from the training set.  

## Evasion Attack

### 2020

- Understanding and Diagnosing Vulnerability under Adversarial Attacks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08716)
  - Haizhong Zheng, Ziqi Zhang, Honglak Lee, Atul Prakash.
  - Digest: In this work, we propose a novel interpretability method, InterpretGAN, to generate explanations for features used for classification in latent variables. Interpreting the classification process of adversarial examples exposes how adversarial perturbations influence features layer by layer as well as which features are modified by perturbations.  

- Do Adversarially Robust ImageNet Models Transfer Better? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489) [[code]](https://github.com/Microsoft/robust-models-transfer)
  - Hadi Salman, Andrew Ilyas, Logan Engstrom, Ashish Kapoor, Aleksander Madry.
  - Digest: In this work, we identify another such aspect: we find that adversarially robust models, while less accurate, often perform better than their standard-trained counterparts when used for transfer learning. Specifically, we focus on adversarially robust ImageNet classifiers, and show that they yield improved accuracy on a standard suite of downstream classification tasks.  

- Learning perturbation sets for robust machine learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08450) [[code]](https://github.com/locuslab/perturbation_learning)
  - Eric Wong, J. Zico Kolter.
  - Digest: Although much progress has been made towards robust deep learning, a significant gap in robustness remains between real-world perturbations and more narrowly defined sets typically studied in adversarial defenses. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by learning perturbation sets from data, in order to characterize real-world effects for robust training and evaluation.  

- Understanding Adversarial Examples from the Mutual Influence of Images and Perturbations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06189)
  - Chaoning Zhang, Philipp Benz, Tooba Imtiaz, In-So Kweon. *CVPR 2020*
  - Digest: Our results suggest a new perspective towards the relationship between images and universal perturbations: Universal perturbations contain dominant features, and images behave like noise to them. We are the first to achieve the challenging task of a targeted universal attack without utilizing original training data. Our approach using a proxy dataset achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art baselines which utilize the original training dataset.  

- Understanding and Improving Fast Adversarial Training. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02617) [[code]](https://github.com/tml-epfl/understanding-fast-adv-training)
  - Maksym Andriushchenko, Nicolas Flammarion.
  - Digest: We explored the questions of when and why FGSM adversarial training works, and how to improve it by increasing the gradient alignment, and thus the quality of the solution of the inner maximization problem.  

- On Connections between Regularizations for Improving DNN Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02209)
  - Yiwen Guo, Long Chen, Yurong Chen, Changshui Zhang. *TPAMI*
  - Digest: This paper analyzes regularization terms proposed recently for improving the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs), from a theoretical point of view.  

- Biologically Inspired Mechanisms for Adversarial Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16427)
  - Manish V. Reddy, Andrzej Banburski, Nishka Pant, Tomaso Poggio.
  - Digest: In this work, we investigate the role of two biologically plausible mechanisms in adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that the non-uniform sampling performed by the primate retina and the presence of multiple receptive fields with a range of receptive field sizes at each eccentricity improve the robustness of neural networks to small adversarial perturbations.  

- Proper Network Interpretability Helps Adversarial Robustness in Classification. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14748) [[code]](https://github.com/AkhilanB/Proper-Interpretability)
  - Akhilan Boopathy, Sijia Liu, Gaoyuan Zhang, Cynthia Liu, Pin-Yu Chen, Shiyu Chang, Luca Daniel. *ICML 2020*
  - Digest: In this paper, we theoretically show that with a proper measurement of interpretation, it is actually difficult to prevent prediction-evasion adversarial attacks from causing interpretation discrepancy, as confirmed by experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Restricted ImageNet.  

- Smooth Adversarial Training. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14536)
  - Cihang Xie, Mingxing Tan, Boqing Gong, Alan Yuille, Quoc V. Le.
  - Digest: Hence we propose smooth adversarial training (SAT), in which we replace ReLU with its smooth approximations to strengthen adversarial training. The purpose of smooth activation functions in SAT is to allow it to find harder adversarial examples and compute better gradient updates during adversarial training. Compared to standard adversarial training, SAT improves adversarial robustness for "free", i.e., no drop in accuracy and no increase in computational cost.  

- A Causal View on Robustness of Neural Networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01095)
  - Cheng Zhang, Kun Zhang, Yingzhen Li.
  - Digest: We present a causal view on the robustness of neural networks against input manipulations, which applies not only to traditional classification tasks but also to general measurement data. Based on this view, we design a deep causal manipulation augmented model (deep CAMA) which explicitly models possible manipulations on certain causes leading to changes in the observed effect.  

- The Notorious Difficulty of Comparing Human and Machine Perception. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09406) [[code]](https://github.com/bethgelab/notorious_difficulty_of_comparing_human_and_machine_perception)
  - Christina M. Funke, Judy Borowski, Karolina Stosio, Wieland Brendel, Thomas S. A. Wallis, Matthias Bethge.
  - Digest: We show that, despite their ability to solve closed-contour tasks, our neural networks use different decision-making strategies than humans. We further show that there is no fundamental difference between same-different and spatial tasks for common feed-forward neural networks and finally, that neural networks do experience a "recognition gap" on minimal recognizable images. All in all, care has to be taken to not impose our human systematic bias when comparing human and machine perception.  

- Reliable evaluation of adversarial robustness with an ensemble of diverse parameter-free attacks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01690) [[code]](https://github.com/fra31/auto-attack)
  - Francesco Croce, Matthias Hein. *ICML 2020*
  - Digest: In this paper we first propose two extensions of the PGD-attack overcoming failures due to suboptimal step size and problems of the objective function. We then combine our novel attacks with two complementary existing ones to form a parameter-free, computationally affordable and user-independent ensemble of attacks to test adversarial robustness.  

- Overfitting in adversarially robust deep learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11569) [[code]](https://github.com/locuslab/robust_overfitting)
  - Leslie Rice, Eric Wong, J. Zico Kolter. *ICML 2020*
  - Digest: In this paper, we empirically study this phenomenon in the setting of adversarially trained deep networks, which are trained to minimize the loss under worst-case adversarial perturbations. We find that overfitting to the training set does in fact harm robust performance to a very large degree in adversarially robust training across multiple datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet) and perturbation models.  

- Attacks Which Do Not Kill Training Make Adversarial Learning Stronger. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11242)
  - Jingfeng Zhang, Xilie Xu, Bo Han, Gang Niu, Lizhen Cui, Masashi Sugiyama, Mohan Kankanhalli. *ICML 2020*
  - Digest: In this paper, we raise a fundamental question---do we have to trade off natural generalization for adversarial robustness? We argue that adversarial training is to employ confident adversarial data for updating the current model. We propose a novel approach of friendly adversarial training (FAT): rather than employing most adversarial data maximizing the loss, we search for least adversarial (i.e., friendly adversarial) data minimizing the loss, among the adversarial data that are confidently misclassified.  

- The Curious Case of Adversarially Robust Models: More Data Can Help, Double Descend, or Hurt Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11080)
  - Yifei Min, Lin Chen, Amin Karbasi.
  - Digest: In the weak adversary regime, more data improves the generalization of adversarially robust models. In the medium adversary regime, with more training data, the generalization loss exhibits a double descent curve, which implies the existence of an intermediate stage where more training data hurts the generalization. In the strong adversary regime, more data almost immediately causes the generalization error to increase.  

- Understanding and Mitigating the Tradeoff Between Robustness and Accuracy. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10716)
  - Aditi Raghunathan, Sang Michael Xie, Fanny Yang, John Duchi, Percy Liang. *ICML 2020*
  - Digest: In this work, we precisely characterize the effect of augmentation on the standard error in linear regression when the optimal linear predictor has zero standard and robust error.  

- A Bayes-Optimal View on Adversarial Examples. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08859)
  - Eitan Richardson, Yair Weiss.
  - Digest: In this paper, we argue for examining adversarial examples from the perspective of Bayes-Optimal classification. We construct realistic image datasets for which the Bayes-Optimal classifier can be efficiently computed and derive analytic conditions on the distributions so that the optimal classifier is either robust or vulnerable.  

- More Data Can Expand the Generalization Gap Between Adversarially Robust and Standard Models. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04725)
  - Lin Chen, Yifei Min, Mingrui Zhang, Amin Karbasi. *ICML 2020*
  - Digest: The conventional wisdom is that more training data should shrink the generalization gap between adversarially-trained models and standard models. However, we study the training of robust classifiers for both Gaussian and Bernoulli models under l-inf attacks, and we prove that more data may actually increase this gap.  

- Fundamental Tradeoffs between Invariance and Sensitivity to Adversarial Perturbations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04599) [[code]](https://github.com/ftramer/Excessive-Invariance)
  - Florian Tramèr, Jens Behrmann, Nicholas Carlini, Nicolas Papernot, Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen. *ICML 2020*
  - Digest:  We demonstrate fundamental tradeoffs between these two types of adversarial examples.
    We show that defenses against sensitivity-based attacks actively harm a model's accuracy on invariance-based attacks, and that new approaches are needed to resist both attack types.  

### 2019

  - Mislav Balunovic, Martin Vechev. *ICLR 2020*
  - Digest: The key idea is to model neural network training as a procedure which includes both, the verifier and the adversary. In every iteration, the verifier aims to certify the network using convex relaxation while the adversary tries to find inputs inside that convex relaxation which cause verification to fail.  

- Your Classifier is Secretly an Energy Based Model and You Should Treat it Like One. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03263)
  - Will Grathwohl, Kuan-Chieh Wang, Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen, David Duvenaud, Mohammad Norouzi, Kevin Swersky. *ICLR 2020*
  - Digest: Within this framework, standard discriminative architectures may beused and the model can also be trained on unlabeled data. We demonstrate that energy based training of the joint distribution improves calibration, robustness, andout-of-distribution detection while also enabling our models to generate samplesrivaling the quality of recent GAN approaches.  

- When NAS Meets Robustness: In Search of Robust Architectures against Adversarial Attacks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10695) [[code]](https://github.com/gmh14/RobNets)

- Lower Bounds on Adversarial Robustness from Optimal Transport. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12272) [[code]](https://github.com/inspire-group/robustness-via-transport)
  - Arjun Nitin Bhagoji, Daniel Cullina, Prateek Mittal. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest: In this paper, we use optimal transport to characterize the minimum possible loss in an adversarial classification scenario. In this setting, an adversary receives a random labeled example from one of two classes, perturbs the example subject to a neighborhood constraint, and presents the modified example to the classifier.  

- Defending Against Physically Realizable Attacks on Image Classification. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09552) [[code]](https://github.com/tongwu2020/phattacks)
  - Tong Wu, Liang Tong, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik. *ICLR 2020*
  - Digest: First, we demonstrate that the two most scalable and effective methods for learning robust models, adversarial training with PGD attacks and randomized smoothing, exhibit very limited effectiveness against three of the highest profile physical attacks. Next, we propose a new abstract adversarial model, rectangular occlusion attacks, in which an adversary places a small adversarially crafted rectangle in an image, and develop two approaches for efficiently computing the resulting adversarial examples.  

- Biologically inspired sleep algorithm for artificial neural networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02240)
  - Giri P Krishnan, Timothy Tadros, Ramyaa Ramyaa, Maxim Bazhenov. *ICLR 2020*
  - Digest:  We provide a theoretical basis for the beneficial role of the brain-inspired sleep-like phase for the ANNs and present an algorithmic way for future implementations of the various features of sleep in deep learning ANNs.  

- Defense Against Adversarial Attacks Using Feature Scattering-based Adversarial Training. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10764) [[code]](https://github.com/Haichao-Zhang/FeatureScatter)
  - Haichao Zhang, Jianyu Wang. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest: We introduce a feature scattering-based adversarial training approach for improving model robustness against adversarial attacks. Conventional adversarial training approaches leverage a supervised scheme (either targeted or non-targeted) in generating attacks for training, which typically suffer from issues such as label leaking as noted in recent works.  

- Image Synthesis with a Single (Robust) Classifier. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09453) [[code]](https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness_applications?)
  - Shibani Santurkar, Dimitris Tsipras, Brandon Tran, Andrew Ilyas, Logan Engstrom, Aleksander Madry. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest: The crux of our approach is that we train this classifier to be adversarially robust. It turns out that adversarial robustness is precisely what we need to directly manipulate salient features of the input. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of robustness in the broader machine learning context.  

- Convergence of Adversarial Training in Overparametrized Neural Networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07916)
  - Ruiqi Gao, Tianle Cai, Haochuan Li, Liwei Wang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jason D. Lee. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest:  This paper provides a partial answer to the success of adversarial training, by showing that it converges to a network where the surrogate loss with respect to the the attack algorithm is within theta of the optimal robust loss.  

- Lower Bounds for Adversarially Robust PAC Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05815)
  - Dimitrios I. Diochnos, Saeed Mahloujifar, Mohammad Mahmoody. *ISAIM 2020*
  - Digest: We formalize hybrid attacks in which the evasion attack is preceded by a poisoning attack. This is perhaps reminiscent of "trapdoor attacks" in which a poisoning phase is involved as well, but the evasion phase here uses the error-region definition of risk that aims at misclassifying the perturbed instances.

- Adversarial Robustness as a Prior for Learned Representations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00945) [[code]](https://github.com/MadryLab/robust_representations)
  - Logan Engstrom, Andrew Ilyas, Shibani Santurkar, Dimitris Tsipras, Brandon Tran, Aleksander Madry.
  - Digest: In this work, we show that robust optimization can be re-cast as a tool for enforcing priors on the features learned by deep neural networks. It turns out that representations learned by robust models address the aforementioned shortcomings and make significant progress towards learning a high-level encoding of inputs.  

- Unlabeled Data Improves Adversarial Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13736) [[code]](https://github.com/yaircarmon/semisup-adv)
  - Yair Carmon, Aditi Raghunathan, Ludwig Schmidt, Percy Liang, John C. Duchi. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest: Theoretically, we revisit the simple Gaussian model of [Schmidt et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11285). that shows a sample complexity gap between standard and robust classification. We prove that unlabeled data bridges this gap: a simple semi-supervised learning procedure (self-training) achieves high robust accuracy using the same number of labels required for achieving high standard accuracy.  

- Are Labels Required for Improving Adversarial Robustness? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13725) [[code]](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/unsupervised_adversarial_training)
  - Jonathan Uesato, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Po-Sen Huang, Robert Stanforth, Alhussein Fawzi, Pushmeet Kohli. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest: Our main insight is that unlabeled data can be a competitive alternative to labeled data for training adversarially robust models. Theoretically, we show that in a simple statistical setting, the sample complexity for learning an adversarially robust model from unlabeled data matches the fully supervised case up to constant factors.  

- High Frequency Component Helps Explain the Generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13545) [[code]](https://github.com/HaohanWang/HFC)
  - Haohan Wang, Xindi Wu, Zeyi Huang, Eric P. Xing. *CVPR 2020*
  - Digest: We investigate the relationship between the frequency spectrum of image data and the generalization behavior of convolutional neural networks (CNN). We first notice CNN's ability in capturing the high-frequency components of images. These high-frequency components are almost imperceptible to a human.

  - Tianyuan Zhang, Zhanxing Zhu. *ICML 2019*
  - Digest: Surprisingly, we find that adversarial training alleviates the texture bias of standard CNNs when trained on object recognition tasks, and helps CNNs learn a more shape-biased representation.  

- Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02175) [[dataset]](https://github.com/MadryLab/constructed-datasets)
  - Andrew Ilyas, Shibani Santurkar, Dimitris Tsipras, Logan Engstrom, Brandon Tran, Aleksander Madry. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest: We demonstrate that adversarial examples can be directly attributed to the presence of non-robust features: features derived from patterns in the data distribution that are highly predictive, yet brittle and incomprehensible to humans.  

- You Only Propagate Once: Accelerating Adversarial Training via Maximal Principle. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00877) [[code]](https://github.com/a1600012888/YOPO-You-Only-Propagate-Once)
  - Dinghuai Zhang, Tianyuan Zhang, Yiping Lu, Zhanxing Zhu, Bin Dong. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest: In this paper, we show that adversarial training can be cast as a discrete time differential game. Through analyzing the Pontryagin's Maximal Principle (PMP) of the problem, we observe that the adversary update is only coupled with the parameters of the first layer of the network. This inspires us to restrict most of the forward and back propagation within the first layer of the network during adversary updates.

  - Yandong Li, Lijun Li, Liqiang Wang, Tong Zhang, Boqing Gong. *ICML 2019*
  - Digest: Instead of searching for an "optimal" adversarial example for a benign input to a targeted DNN, our algorithm finds a probability density distribution over a small region centered around the input, such that a sample drawn from this distribution is likely an adversarial example, without the need of accessing the DNN's internal layers or weights.  

- Unrestricted Adversarial Examples via Semantic Manipulation. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06347) [[code]](https://github.com/AI-secure/Big-but-Invisible-Adversarial-Attack)
  - Anand Bhattad, Min Jin Chong, Kaizhao Liang, Bo Li, D. A. Forsyth. *ICLR 2020*
  - Digest: In this paper, we instead introduce "unrestricted" perturbations that manipulate semantically meaningful image-based visual descriptors - color and texture - in order to generate effective and photorealistic adversarial examples. We show that these semantically aware perturbations are effective against JPEG compression, feature squeezing and adversarially trained model.

- VC Classes are Adversarially Robustly Learnable, but Only Improperly. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04217)
  - Omar Montasser, Steve Hanneke, Nathan Srebro. *COLT 2019*
  - Digest: We study the question of learning an adversarially robust predictor. We show that any hypothesis class H with finite VC dimension is robustly PAC learnable with an improper learning rule. The requirement of being improper is necessary as we exhibit examples of hypothesis classes H with finite VC dimension that are not robustly PAC learnable with any proper learning rule.

- Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918) [[code]](https://github.com/locuslab/smoothing)
  - Jeremy M Cohen, Elan Rosenfeld, J. Zico Kolter. *ICML 2019*
  - Digest: We show how to turn any classifier that classifies well under Gaussian noise into a new classifier that is certifiably robust to adversarial perturbations under the L-2 norm. This "randomized smoothing" technique has been proposed recently in the literature, but existing guarantees are loose. We prove a tight robustness guarantee in L-2 norm for smoothing with Gaussian noise.  

- Theoretically Principled Trade-off between Robustness and Accuracy. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08573) [[code]](https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES)
  - Hongyang Zhang, Yaodong Yu, Jiantao Jiao, Eric P. Xing, Laurent El Ghaoui, Michael I. Jordan. *ICML 2019*
  - Digest: In this work, we decompose the prediction error for adversarial examples (robust error) as the sum of the natural (classification) error and boundary error, and provide a differentiable upper bound using the theory of classification-calibrated loss, which is shown to be the tightest possible upper bound uniform over all probability distributions and measurable predictors. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we also design a new defense method, TRADES, to trade adversarial robustness off against accuracy.  

### 2018

- Feature Denoising for Improving Adversarial Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03411) [[code]](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ImageNet-Adversarial-Training)
  - Cihang Xie, Yuxin Wu, Laurens van der Maaten, Alan Yuille, Kaiming He. *CVPR 2019*
  - Digest: This study suggests that adversarial perturbations on images lead to noise in the features constructed by these networks. Motivated by this observation, we develop new network architectures that increase adversarial robustness by performing feature denoising. Specifically, our networks contain blocks that denoise the features using non-local means or other filters; the entire networks are trained end-to-end.  

- Strike (with) a Pose: Neural Networks Are Easily Fooled by Strange Poses of Familiar Objects. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11553) [[code]](https://github.com/airalcorn2/strike-with-a-pose)
  - Michael A. Alcorn, Qi Li, Zhitao Gong, Chengfei Wang, Long Mai, Wei-Shinn Ku, Anh Nguyen. *CVPR 2019*
  - Digest: In this paper, we present a framework for discovering DNN failures that harnesses 3D renderers and 3D models. That is, we estimate the parameters of a 3D renderer that cause a target DNN to misbehave in response to the rendered image.  

- Excessive Invariance Causes Adversarial Vulnerability. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00401)
  - Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen, Jens Behrmann, Richard Zemel, Matthias Bethge. *ICLR 2019*
  - Digest: We show deep networks are not only too sensitive to task-irrelevant changes of their input, as is well-known from epsilon-adversarial examples, but are also too invariant to a wide range of task-relevant changes, thus making vast regions in input space vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We show such excessive invariance occurs across various tasks and architecture types.  

- Rademacher Complexity for Adversarially Robust Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11914)
  - Dong Yin, Kannan Ramchandran, Peter Bartlett. *ICML 2019*
  - Digest: In this paper, we focus on L-inf attacks, and study the adversarially robust generalization problem through the lens of Rademacher complexity. For binary linear classifiers, we prove tight bounds for the adversarial Rademacher complexity, and show that the adversarial Rademacher complexity is never smaller than its natural counterpart, and it has an unavoidable dimension dependence, unless the weight vector has bounded L-1 norm.  

- Attacks Meet Interpretability: Attribute-steered Detection of Adversarial Samples. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11580)
  - Guanhong Tao, Shiqing Ma, Yingqi Liu, Xiangyu Zhang. *NeurIPS 2018*
  - Digest: We argue that adversarial sample attacks are deeply entangled with interpretability of DNN models: while classification results on benign inputs can be reasoned based on the human perceptible features/attributes, results on adversarial samples can hardly be explained. Therefore, we propose a novel adversarial sample detection technique for face recognition models, based on interpretability.  

- Sparse DNNs with Improved Adversarial Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09619)
  - Yiwen Guo, Chao Zhang, Changshui Zhang, Yurong Chen.
  - Digest: Our analyses reveal, both theoretically and empirically, that nonlinear DNN-based classifiers behave differently under l2 attacks from some linear ones. We further demonstrate that an appropriately higher model sparsity implies better robustness of nonlinear DNNs, whereas over-sparsified models can be more difficult to resist adversarial examples.  

- PAC-learning in the presence of evasion adversaries. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01471)
  - Daniel Cullina, Arjun Nitin Bhagoji, Prateek Mittal. *NeurIPS 2018*
  - Digest: In this paper, we step away from the attack-defense arms race and seek to understand the limits of what can be learned in the presence of an evasion adversary. In particular, we extend the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-learning framework to account for the presence of an adversary.  

- Robustness May Be at Odds with Accuracy. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12152)
  - Dimitris Tsipras, Shibani Santurkar, Logan Engstrom, Alexander Turner, Aleksander Madry. *ICLR 2019*
  - Digest: We show that there may exist an inherent tension between the goal of adversarial robustness and that of standard generalization.  Specifically, training robust models may not only be more resource-consuming, but also lead to a reduction of standard accuracy.  

- Adversarial examples from computational constraints. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10204)
  - Sébastien Bubeck, Eric Price, Ilya Razenshteyn. *ICML 2019*
  - Digest: First we prove that, for a broad set of classification tasks, the mere existence of a robust classifier implies that it can be found by a possibly exponential-time algorithm with relatively few training examples. Then we give a particular classification task where learning a robust classifier is computationally intractable.  

- Towards the first adversarially robust neural network model on MNIST. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09190)
  - Lukas Schott, Jonas Rauber, Matthias Bethge, Wieland Brendel. *ICLR 2019*
  - Digest: We present a novel robust classification model that performs analysis by synthesis using learned class-conditional data distributions. We demonstrate that most adversarial examples are strongly perturbed towards the perceptual boundary between the original and the adversarial class.

- Adversarially Robust Generalization Requires More Data. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11285)
  - Ludwig Schmidt, Shibani Santurkar, Dimitris Tsipras, Kunal Talwar, Aleksander Mądry. *NeurIPS 2018*
  - Digest: We show that already in a simple natural data model, the sample complexity of robust learning can be significantly larger than that of "standard" learning. This gap is information theoretic and holds irrespective of the training algorithm or the model family.  

- Obfuscated Gradients Give a False Sense of Security: Circumventing Defenses to Adversarial Examples. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00420) [[code]](https://github.com/anishathalye/obfuscated-gradients)
  - Anish Athalye, Nicholas Carlini, David Wagner. *ICML 2018*
  - Digest: We identify obfuscated gradients, a kind of gradient masking, as a phenomenon that leads to a false sense of security in defenses against adversarial examples. While defenses that cause obfuscated gradients appear to defeat iterative optimization-based attacks, we find defenses relying on this effect can be circumvented.  

- Stochastic Activation Pruning for Robust Adversarial Defense. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01442) [[code]](https://github.com/Guneet-Dhillon/Stochastic-Activation-Pruning)
  - Guneet S. Dhillon, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Zachary C. Lipton, Jeremy Bernstein, Jean Kossaifi, Aran Khanna, Anima Anandkumar. *ICLR 2018*
  - Digest: We propose Stochastic Activation Pruning (SAP), a mixed strategy for adversarial defense. SAP prunes a random subset of activations (preferentially pruning those with smaller magnitude) and scales up the survivors to compensate.  

- Adversarial vulnerability for any classifier. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08686)
  - Alhussein Fawzi, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi. *NeurIPS 2018*
  - Digest: In this paper, we study the phenomenon of adversarial perturbations under the assumption that the data is generated with a smooth generative model. We derive fundamental upper bounds on the robustness to perturbations of any classification function, and prove the existence of adversarial perturbations that transfer well across different classifiers with small risk.  

### 2017

- Certifying Some Distributional Robustness with Principled Adversarial Training. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10571)
  - Aman Sinha, Hongseok Namkoong, Riccardo Volpi, John Duchi. *ICLR 2018*
  - Digest: By considering a Lagrangian penalty formulation of perturbing the underlying data distribution in a Wasserstein ball, we provide a training procedure that augments model parameter updates with worst-case perturbations of training data. For smooth losses, our procedure provably achieves moderate levels of robustness with little computational or statistical cost relative to empirical risk minimization.  

- One pixel attack for fooling deep neural networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08864)
  - Jiawei Su, Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas, Sakurai Kouichi. *IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation*
  - Digest: In this paper, we analyze an attack in an extremely limited scenario where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution (DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE.  

### 2016

- Practical Black-Box Attacks against Machine Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02697)
  - Nicolas Papernot, Patrick McDaniel, Ian Goodfellow, Somesh Jha, Z. Berkay Celik, Ananthram Swami. *AsiaCCS 2017*
  - Digest: We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Our attack evades a category of defenses, which we call gradient masking, previously proposed to increase resilience to adversarial examples.  

## Poisoning Attack

### 2020

- Reflection Backdoor: A Natural Backdoor Attack on Deep Neural Networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02343)
  - Yunfei Liu, Xingjun Ma, James Bailey, Feng Lu. *ECCV 2020*
  - Digest: In this paper, we present a new type of backdoor attack inspired by an important natural phenomenon: reflection. Using mathematical modeling of physical reflection models, we propose reflection backdoor (Refool) to plant reflections as backdoor into a victim model.  

### 2017

- BadNets: Identifying Vulnerabilities in the Machine Learning Model Supply Chain. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06733)
  - Tianyu Gu, Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, Siddharth Garg.
  - Digest:  In this paper we show that outsourced training introduces new security risks: an adversary can create a maliciously trained network (a backdoored neural network, or a BadNet that has state-of-the-art performance on the user's training and validation samples, but behaves badly on specific attacker-chosen inputs.  

## Extraction Attack

### 2017

- Towards Reverse-Engineering Black-Box Neural Networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01768) [[code]](https://github.com/coallaoh/WhitenBlackBox)
  - Seong Joon Oh, Max Augustin, Bernt Schiele, Mario Fritz. *ICLR 2018*
  - Digest: This work shows that such attributes of neural networks can be exposed from a sequence of queries. This has multiple implications. On the one hand, our work exposes the vulnerability of black-box neural networks to different types of attacks -- we show that the revealed internal information helps generate more effective adversarial examples against the black box model.  

## Inversion Attack

### 2020

- A Framework for Evaluating Gradient Leakage Attacks in Federated Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10397)
  - Wenqi Wei, Ling Liu, Margaret Loper, Ka-Ho Chow, Mehmet Emre Gursoy, Stacey Truex, Yanzhao Wu.
  - Digest: In this paper, we present a principled framework for evaluating and comparing different forms of client privacy leakage attacks. We first provide formal and experimental analysis to show how adversaries can reconstruct the private local training data by simply analyzing the shared parameter update from local training (e.g., local gradient or weight update vector).  

- Inverting Gradients -- How easy is it to break privacy in federated learning? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14053) [[code]](https://github.com/JonasGeiping/invertinggradients)
  - Jonas Geiping, Hartmut Bauermeister, Hannah Dröge, Michael Moeller.
  - Digest: In this paper we show that sharing parameter gradients is by no means secure: By exploiting a cosine similarity loss along with optimization methods from adversarial attacks, we are able to faithfully reconstruct images at high resolution from the knowledge of their parameter gradients, and demonstrate that such a break of privacy is possible even for trained deep networks.  

- iDLG: Improved Deep Leakage from Gradients. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02610) [[code]](https://github.com/PatrickZH/Improved-Deep-Leakage-from-Gradients)
  - Bo Zhao, Konda Reddy Mopuri, Hakan Bilen.
  - Digest: DLG has difficulty in convergence and discovering the ground-truth labels consistently. In this paper, we find that sharing gradients definitely leaks the ground-truth labels. We propose a simple but reliable approach to extract accurate data from the gradients.  

### 2019

- Deep Leakage from Gradients. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08935) [[code]](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/dlg)
  - Ligeng Zhu, Zhijian Liu, Song Han. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest: We show that it is possible to obtain the private training data from the publicly shared gradients. We name this leakage as Deep Leakage from Gradient and empirically validate the effectiveness on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks.

- Rethinking Deep Neural Network Ownership Verification: Embedding Passports to Defeat Ambiguity Attacks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07830) [[code]](https://github.com/kamwoh/DeepIPR)
  - Lixin Fan, Kam Woh Ng, Chee Seng Chan. *NeurIPS 2019*
  - Digest: This work proposes novel passport-based DNN ownership verification schemes which are both robust to network modifications and resilient to ambiguity attacks. The gist of embedding digital passports is to design and train DNN models in a way such that, the DNN model performance of an original task will be significantly deteriorated due to forged passports.
